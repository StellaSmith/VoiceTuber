(Verse 1)
I got a sock, I got a clock
Uh! Sock-Clock!

I got a frog, I got a log
Uh! Frog-Log!

Sock-Clock, Frog-Log
Uh! Sock-Clock-Frog-Log

(Chorus)
Sock-Clock-Frog-Log Song
It's the Sock-Clock-Frog-Log Song
Gather 'round, come and sing along
Everybody do the Sock-Clock-Frog-Log Song

(Verse 2)
I got a shoe, I got some glue
Uh! Shoe-Glue!

I got a goat, I got a boat
Uh! Goat-Boat!

Shoe-Glue, Goat-Boat
Uh! Shoe-Glue-Goat-Boat

(Chorus)
Shoe-Glue-Goat-Boat Song
It's the Shoe-Glue-Goat-Boat Song
Gather 'round, come and sing along
Everybody do the Shoe-Glue-Goat-Boat Song

(Bridge)
Now, here's a twist, listen close, don't miss
We're gonna mix it up, it's gonna be a hit

Sock-Clock-Frog-Log, Shoe-Glue-Goat-Boat
Uh! Surprise-Mega-Mashup-FLOAT!

(Chorus)
Surprise-Mega-Mashup-FLOAT Song
It's the Surprise-Mega-Mashup-FLOAT Song
Gather 'round, come and sing along
Everybody do the Surprise-Mega-Mashup-FLOAT Song

(Outro)
Sock-Clock, Frog-Log, Shoe-Glue, Goat-Boat
All together now, don't you know?
We made a viral hit, we're on a roll
Come on, everybody, let's lose control!
